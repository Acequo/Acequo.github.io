  <p> I've lived so many lives and finally it's this one that I've chosen to keep. <br> <br> Alexine Le Port <br>  MSc student in bioinformatics and you can find more infos about it <a href="/link-to-mid-articles" style="color: #f0166f;">here</a>. Every sunday I read about theology, the rest of the time: philosophy and sci-fi. I'm pretty good at <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/auwtkox85ovn7ahyyvuv64gql?si=cded6bf4e4ac4a8f" style="color: #f0166f;">creating playlists</a> and sometimes I play music. Recently, I've developed a crush on computer architecture. From an aesthetic standpoint: I appreciate horror, cyberpunk and fashion. Not a fan of cats,ideology, journalism, <a href="/assets/badfaith.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #f0166f;">NPC's behaviors</a> and Windows.  <br> <br> <br> Read my mid-articles here : </p>
