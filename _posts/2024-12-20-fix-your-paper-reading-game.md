If research papers feel like a grind and not something you can truly enjoy, it’s probably because you haven’t found the right approach yet. Simply browsing through them casually won’t cut it.  Like any skill you want to excel at, the key is learning how to analyze effectively. Analyzing and breaking down papers not only helps you understand and retain their content, but it also allows you to truly appreciate them. Its like playing a game where the more you engage, the more rewarding it becomes. <span style="color: white;"> Here’s my method : </span>



## <span style="color: white;"> Set the Stage</span>

Start by working with physical copies of the papers or using a tablet so you can highlight and annotate as you go. Before long, you’ll see that most papers share a similar structure inside their parts (introductions, methods, results). With time, you’ll know exactly where to look for what you need. I’ve put together a pdf template that I personally use sometimes, here's the page for <a href="/assets/paper-review.png" target="_blank" style="color: white;">paper reviews</a>. I refined my own method with [SAFARI](https://safari.ethz.ch) ’s approach, and it’s so effective.

Try this technique on about 5-10 papers. Initially, it might feel like you’re moving slowly, but stick with it. If you’re struggling, consider using a tool like ChatGPT for the first couple of attempts. Once you’ve got a handle on things, the process becomes much easier.

### <span style="color: white;"> Problem/State of the Art</span>
Identify the problem the paper addresses and how it fits into existing research. Understanding the gap they’re trying to fill sets the stage for why the paper matters.

### <span style="color: white;"> Goal</span>
Pin down the paper’s main objective. Are the authors aiming for better accuracy, lower computational cost, or a fresh theoretical insight? Clearly defining the goal helps you judge whether the solution really hits the mark.

### <span style="color: white;"> Challenges</span>
What makes this problem tough? Is it data scarcity, hardware constraints, or theoretical hurdles? Recognizing these challenges puts the work into perspective, showing why their contribution is significant.

### <span style="color: white;"> Key Mechanism</span>
Focus on how they’re solving the problem. What methods, algorithms, or frameworks do they introduce or refine? You don’t need to digest every last detail, just get a solid grasp of the core idea.

### <span style="color: white;"> Key Results</span>
Look at the evidence they provide. How much does their method improve accuracy, speed things up, or reduce costs? Are there trade-offs, like increased memory usage? This helps you assess the actual impact of their claims.

### <span style="color: white;"> Strengths</span>
Reflect on the strengths of the paper by considering whether it effectively addresses a major problem and whether its methodology introduces something truly novel. Assess how the paper contributes to the field and whether its insights feel impactful or groundbreaking. This reflection helps solidify your understanding of the paper's value.

### <span style="color: white;"> Improvrments</span>
Now, think about where the paper could’ve done better. Did the evaluations cover everything important, or was something missed? Were there parts that felt confusing or poorly explained? Maybe the experiments needed more depth, or some of the claims felt exaggerated. Noticing these things helps you think more critically and really engage with the paper.

### <span style="color: white;"> What I Learned/Liked</span>
Consider what you personally gained from the paper. Did it introduce a new concept you hadn’t seen before? Offer a fresh perspective on a familiar problem?

### <span style="color: white;"> Summary Brief of the Paper
End by writing a short summary in your own words. yea, it might feel repetitive, but it’s an excellent way to cement what you’ve learned and ensure you truly understand the material.

If research papers feel like a grind and not something you can truly enjoy, it’s probably because you haven’t found the right approach yet. Simply browsing through them casually won’t cut it. Like any skill, learning how to analyze effectively will change the game. By breaking down papers step-by-step, you won’t just understand and retain their content—you’ll also learn to appreciate their depth. Think of it like a puzzle: the more you engage, the more rewarding the experience becomes. Here’s my quick method.

## Developing an Appreciation

Don’t be surprised if this method feels overwhelming at first. It’s like learning to appreciate art. I’m going to quote it again: Voltaire’s essay Goût from Diderot’s Encyclopédie explains that someone new to art might not immediately recognize its value. But after repeated visits to galleries, he will start to notice subtle techniques like brushstrokes, color balance, and composition. With habits and creativity(like thinking about similarities and differences) they eventually develop a taste for it.

The same goes for reading research papers. In the beginning, it’s time-consuming and mentally taxing. But as you practice, you’ll start to recognize patterns, appreciate finer points, and even look forward to digging into new material.

## When You're Done with This Exercise

Then when you’re done with it, you could spend less time reading papers and even read them in diagonal. At that point, you won’t need to write everything about the paper but just the general idea and some thoughts. I’ve seen this [X post](https://x.com/jxmnop/status/1864698984918401394), which I really like and I think it’s the next step when you want to take notes.

You can then refine your process further or experiment with new techniques—it’s all about evolving your approach as you become more skilled.

Just do it, if it doesnt work, you're lying to yourself.
