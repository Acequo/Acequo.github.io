    <h1>Effectively Do Technical Analysis</h1>
    <p><strong>Want to effectively do technical analysis on the fly just like me?</strong><br>
    Here’s how...</p>

    <blockquote><strong>Mentor &gt; Mentee</strong></blockquote>

    <h2>1. Beginning</h2>
    <p>In trading, one of the most effective yet overlooked techniques is <strong>top-down analysis</strong> — starting by aligning multiple timeframes to create high-probability setups. Most traders often enter based on a single timeframe pattern and get stopped out because they’ve ignored the bigger picture. Here, I’ll break down how to apply it step-by-step and walk through real examples that show its effectiveness.</p>

    <p>A common mistake is trading off a bullish lower-timeframe signal without considering the higher-timeframe context. For example, a bullish order block might appear attractive on a 15-minute chart, but if the daily chart is showing bearish expansion, that lower-timeframe setup is more likely to fail. When you align all your timeframes in the same direction, you get the kind of price expansion that creates high-probability trades.</p>

    <p>Don’t expect a 100 percent win rate. The goal here isn’t to be perfect — it’s to execute and be effective. You’ll see your trading experience responding in uniform.</p>

    <p>If you’re a <strong>noob</strong> or <strong>pro</strong> trader, everything is possible here. You can follow this effective article to get started, but if you want stable performance and efficiency, follow me on X.</p>

    <p>Your technical analysis determines everything — psychology, edge, and whether your trading style supports scalps or intraday. That’s what defines how fast your consistency will run or if it’ll expire. You can ask ChatGPT if your trading psychology supports the model you want to use (sike... retard).</p>

    <h2>2. Establish a Higher-Timeframe Bias</h2>
    <p>Start with a higher timeframe (daily, weekly, or even monthly depending on your trading style) to identify your overall market bias.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Look for swing highs/lows, sweeps of liquidity, and candle closures, observing AMD (ICT concept).</li>
      <li>Determine if the higher timeframe is likely to expand higher, expand lower, or consolidate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the daily has swept a previous high and closed back inside the range with a bearish engulfing candle, your bias is likely bearish.</p>

    <h3>Time &amp; Price *</h3>

    <h2>3. Define Structure on an Intermediate Timeframe</h2>
    <p>Once you have your bias, drop to an intermediate timeframe (e.g., 4H or 1H) to map out structure. Confirm your higher-timeframe bias by checking for a market-structure shift, change in the state of delivery (CISD), or displacement.</p>
    <p>Identify points of interest that align with your higher-timeframe bias. My favorite is <strong>IRL-ERL</strong>. Wait for a reaction, candle closure, or protected swing in that point of interest.</p>

    <h2>4. Refine Entry on a Lower Timeframe</h2>
    <p>This is where you refine your entry for optimal risk-to-reward — usually 5 m or 15 m. Following the intermediate-timeframe candle closure or reaction, look for a CISD to confirm your alignment. Your higher, intermediate, and lower timeframes should all be pointing in the same direction now.</p>

    <p>Seek entries following new protected lows or continuation order blocks. Place stops beyond the protected high/low and target higher-timeframe objectives.</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p><strong>Daily Bias:</strong> Price is in a bullish trend, following expansion higher. Price retraces into an imbalance and then forms a protected swing. After another expansion higher, price takes out a high, retraces into a newly created fair-value gap, and retests the opening price (OHLC in consideration) in the order block. Price has a bullish daily closure.</p>

    <p><strong>Hourly Structure:</strong> Price has a CISD at the reversal point. Following this reversal there is a fair-value gap in the upper half of the previous day’s wick — this is ideal. Price reaches into the FVG and has a bullish candle closure.</p>

    <p>Now, while you can refine this down to the lower timeframes for entry, it is also valid to take entries on the structure timeframe, entering upon the new protected swing.</p>
